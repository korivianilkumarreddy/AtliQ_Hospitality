# AtliQ Hospitality ‚Äì Revenue Insights (Power BI Project)

This project focuses on **revenue insights for AtliQ Hospitality**, a hotel chain operating in multiple cities across India.  
Using Power BI, I designed an end-to-end dashboard that helps management analyze **key performance metrics** like revenue, occupancy, cancellations, and average ratings, providing actionable insights for business decisions.
